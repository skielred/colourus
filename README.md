# colourus
colourus is a very simple start page full of shortcuts to pages you usually visit.

What it looks like
![Example](.gh/colourus.png "example image")

# config
The config.js is fairly easy to understand if you take a look at the first search category in the file.
You also aren't able to use custom colors on the super text.
